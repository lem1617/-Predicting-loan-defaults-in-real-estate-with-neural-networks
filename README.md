# -Predicting-loan-defaults-in-real-estate-with-neural-networks

### Introduction
In order to investigate the applicability of the Neural Networks (NN) model to the classification problem, the HMEQ dataset on real estate loan defaults was implemented. Using the HMEQ data set, a prediction was made using the NN model in Python as to whether a customer would receive a loan from the bank or not. First, an overview of the data in the dataset was visualized. Furthermore, an efficient procedure for data pre-processing was developed. Also, some optimization methods were applied toANN to get the best result. Logistic regression and random forest were also used to ask questions to find the best fitting model for the given data set. After performing the predictions with three models, the Logistic Regression classification accuracy was the lowest at 83.88%, while the NN accuracy was 88.13% and the Random Forest accuracy was 91.85%. Random Forest, NN and Logistic Regression show predictive results quite well. Random Forest performs better than NN, and NN performs better than Logistic Regression. Random forest appears to be the most suitable, followed by NN and the least suitable is logistic regression. Because NN is particularly well suited for large amounts of data, the result can still improve in favor of NN when using much larger data sets than provided by HMEQ. It may be useful to investigate NN for larger amounts of data in future work and to support credit risk management
